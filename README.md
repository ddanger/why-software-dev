- You spend most time learning new concepts and thinking about how to build things and make them work with those concepts

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## Standard Way to Get In 🎓
- Bachelors Degree (Masters doesn't hurt, usually helps):

  - Information Systems
  - Many others...

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## Alternative Ways 📚

- Independent Study (personal portfolio)
- Probably less pay for first few years, but
- Once you're proven lack of degree doesn't matter
